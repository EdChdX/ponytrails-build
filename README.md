# ponylive-compose
Shell scripts (bash or zsh) to compose Debian based live system.

The live system focuses more on being a portable workstation.

# Install
You can get the files (maybe) from GitHub releases, or from our distribution server. We also will release on IPFS and BitTorrent to reduce server load.

You can then either choose to flash it directly on a portable drive, or use Ventoy. Running via Ventoy is highly recommended.
